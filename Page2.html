  <p>The vegetable farming process starts with soil preparation, followed by planting seeds or seedlings. Regular
    irrigation,
    weeding, and pest control ensure healthy growth. Farmers monitor the crops and apply fertilizers as needed. Once the
    vegetables mature, they are harvested manually or with machines, then cleaned, sorted, and packed. Proper storage
    and
    transportation help maintain freshness before reaching markets or consumers.</p>
  <img src="pic5.jpg" alt="Harvesting">
  <p>Our company follows a systematic approach to harvesting vegetables to ensure efficiency, quality, and minimal
    waste. The process begins with careful monitoring of crop maturity, using factors like size, color, and ripeness to
    determine the right time for harvesting. Depending on the type of vegetable, harvesting is done manually by skilled
    workers or mechanically using specialized machines. Leafy greens and delicate crops are often hand-picked to prevent
    damage, while root vegetables and large-scale crops like potatoes and carrots are harvested using automated
    equipment.
    After harvesting, vegetables are transported to processing units where they are cleaned, sorted, and graded based on
    <!-- quality. Some companies use advanced technology like automated sorting and cold storage to maintain freshness and
    extend -->
    <!-- shelf life. Finally, the harvested produce is packed and distributed to markets, retailers, or consumers, ensuring a -->
    steady supply of fresh, high-quality vegetables."
