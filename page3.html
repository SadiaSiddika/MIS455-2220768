  <p>After harvesting, broccoli is quickly cooled using ice or hydro-cooling to preserve its freshness. It is then
    stored in
    cold storage at 0-4°C (32-39°F) with high humidity to prevent wilting. Ventilated crates or modified atmosphere
    packaging help maintain quality during storage and transport. This ensures that broccoli remains fresh until it
    reaches
    markets or consumers.</p>
